Steps for starting the project:

- This project is based on Mortgage application.
- The front-end project "mortgage.client"  is developed in ReactJs with Javascript & backend CustomerMortgage in .NET Core Web API 5.0. 
- I have used VS Code fro front-end and VS 2019 for backend development as an   editor.
- Backend is used as SQL Server.
- Steps to open the project:
	- Open VS Code editor and open \mortgage.client client which is front-end
 	- Open Web API project in VS 2019 editor.
	- Execute below commands for Front-end libraries.
        - Install these dependencies to runt he project: npm install, npm i -s axios, npm install bootstrap ,npm i -s redux react-redux redux-thunk
	- Open "DBScript" file and copy the command and execute in SQL server to create required DB and tables.
	- Coneciton string should be changed in backend API project to run the project in users environment.
	- Please change in conenction string in appsettings.json file.
	- "AllowedHosts": "*",
  		"ConnectionStrings": {
    		"MortgageDB": "Data Source=LAPTOP-OP0KIBPM\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=MortgageDB;Integrated Security=True"
  		},

- Once all these dependencies installed through terminal windows,DB generated,  please start the Web API project.
- Web API project is will run on localhost.
- Then start the Front -end project by executing command "npm start" on VS Code.
- Please make sure the localhost port on which front-end run on should also defined in Web API project in startup.cs class.
-    app.UseCors(options => 
                options.WithOrigins("http://localhost:3000")
                .AllowAnyHeader()
